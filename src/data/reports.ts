          "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My main tasks during this term was similar to my previous terms. Things I had to do was to maintain and add new software features like APIs, frontend code, SQL stored procedures to a grower website and various campaign sites according to the business requirements and quality assurance items of the account team. This term however I also had the chance to develop a web application from scratch including its DB design, backend/frontend code. The technologies I used were TypeScript, Redux, MSSQL, React.js, Node.js and many other smaller frameworks. The tasks varied from frontend to backend equally. While maintaining and adding new features/sub-applications for these websites was my main task, I also worked on migrating the frontend of that website from the legacy frameworks to more modern frameworks using TS and React/Redux. I already had some grasp on the technologies and the transferable skills that were required for this job before starting, thanks to my previous terms. But I definitely learned more and got better as I went along so I can safely say that this co-op experience definitely enhanced my academic experience as well. I also think I was able to accomplish the goals I set for myself when I first started which I will talk about in more detail in the next section.",

        description: `&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first goal was to enhance my technological literacy, with a particular focus on backend technologies like Node, SQL Server, and various design patterns. Throughout this work term, I tackled numerous tasks and QA tickets that incorporated these technologies. For example, one of the major projects I undertook required me to learn and utilize TypeScript and Redux. Another one, which I already mentioned was creating a web app from scratch which included me to work with backend technologies. By the end of the term, I could complete tasks involving these technologies faster and with fewer errors. I believe I have significantly improved my skills in this area compared to when I first started.
                        <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another goal I set was to improve my inquiry and analysis skills, especially for larger-scale tasks, to ensure effective communication with the team and successful task completion. Throughout this term, I consistently engaged with tasks that required deep reflection and problem-solving. By reflecting on what I learned and communicating effectively with the team, I contributed to generating better solutions, identifying and addressing problems efficiently, and successfully completing all my tasks. I believe my inquiry and analysis skills have improved considerably.
                        <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My final goal was to enhance my teamwork abilities, particularly in collaborating with others and dividing work to complete tasks successfully. This term, I worked on several projects that required significant collaboration. For instance, during the big migration task and some smaller application developments, teamwork played a crucial role. Compared to previous terms, I had more opportunities to collaborate with my colleagues, effectively splitting up the work and communicating efficiently. I believe I have made substantial progress in improving my teamwork skills.`,

        description: `&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first goal this term was to deepen my understanding of web development, particularly in frontend technologies like TypeScript, React, Redux, and various design patterns. Reflecting on my progress, I was able to work with these technologies extensively, building on the foundational knowledge I gained in my previous term. One significant project that contributed to my growth involved continuing the large-scale migration task I had started at the end of the last term. This project required me to dive deeper into TypeScript and React with Redux, allowing me to improve my proficiency. Additionally, completing various tasks and QA tickets throughout the term further reinforced my understanding. By the end of the term, I could approach tasks involving these technologies with greater speed and accuracy, which is a testament to my improved skill set. I am confident that my abilities in this area have significantly advanced compared to when I first started.
                        <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another goal I set this term was to improve my inquiry and analysis skills, particularly for larger-scale tasks, to ensure effective communication with the team and successful task completion. Throughout this term, I tackled several challenging tasks that required me to apply critical and creative thinking. This allowed me to analyze problems more effectively and communicate solutions clearly with the team, building on the foundation I laid during my first term. By reflecting on what I learned and engaging in thoughtful discussions with my colleagues, I was able to generate better solutions and address problems more efficiently. This led to fewer errors and more successful task completions, demonstrating a significant improvement in my inquiry and analysis skills. I am confident that these skills have grown stronger and will continue to benefit my work in the future.
                        <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My final goal this term was to further improve my ability to work collaboratively with others, especially in splitting up tasks and ensuring successful project completion. Reflecting on my experience, I found that teamwork remained a crucial component of my work, much like in the previous term. The continuation of the large-scale migration task and the development of the calculator app provided many opportunities for collaboration. Given that I had already made significant progress in this area during the last term, the focus this time was on refining those skills. I worked closely with my team, ensuring that tasks were divided efficiently and that communication remained clear and effective. While my improvement in this area was more incremental, I still consider this goal a success. Teamwork skills are something you can always get better at, and this term's experiences helped solidify the skills I had previously developed.`,
